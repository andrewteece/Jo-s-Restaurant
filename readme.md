### Jo's Restaurant Website

The restaurant landing page project will require you to develop a website that showcases the restaurant's menu, reviews, and other essential information. You will need to pay attention to details such as layout, color scheme, typography, and responsiveness to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website.

By working on this project, you will improve your HTML skills by creating semantic markup, CSS skills by designing visually appealing styles, and JS skills by adding interactive elements such as menus, forms, and animations. Additionally, you will also learn how to optimize the website's performance by reducing page load times and ensuring that the website is accessible to all users. Overall, this project will help you develop your front-end skills while creating a practical and usable website for a restaurant.
